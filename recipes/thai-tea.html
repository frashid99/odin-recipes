    <h1>Thai Tea</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>During one of the conference days in Chicago, we escaped out to lunch at a local Thai
         restaurant to explore more of the city’s culinary offerings. As always, we’ll try to
          order something new and different. When we’re at a Thai restaurant, it normally 
          involves ordering our favorites. This includes a curry dish,  one noodle dish and 
          an appetizer. On top of that, we must always have Thai iced tea. Because how can 
          we NOT have Thai iced tea when we eat Thai food? It’s one of those decant “dessert” 
          drinks that helps soothe the burn when we overload on too much of Thai spice.</p>

    <p>Years ago, my Auntie Chung was telling me how easy it was to make Thai iced tea. She 
        had worked in an Asian restaurant and one of the most popular items on the entire 
        menu was Thai iced tea. She proceeded to tell me exactly how to make it and how 
        profitable it was for restaurants to make. I didn’t care too much about the 
        profitability of Thai iced tea. But rather, I’m more interested on how easily it was 
        made and why we didn’t make it more often. The version we have is as authentic as 
        what most Thai restaurants in America are making. Our version really does taste like 
        what we have ordered at most Thai restaurants.</p>
